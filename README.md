📸 Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a real-time face recognition-based attendance system built using Machine Learning. It captures live images through a webcam, detects and recognizes faces, and automatically marks attendance based on pre-trained data.

🔍 Features
📷 Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV and face recognition libraries

🧠 ML model trained on labeled image dataset for accurate identification

🗂️ Automatic attendance marking with timestamp

💾 Attendance data stored in a CSV or database (configurable)

📊 Clean and readable UI/CLI for monitoring and exporting attendance

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV

face_recognition / dlib

NumPy, Pandas

Optional: Flask (for web interface), SQLite / CSV

🚀 How It Works
Train the model using labeled images of individuals.

Launch the system — it activates the webcam and starts scanning faces.

Recognized faces are matched with the trained data.

Attendance is logged with name, date, and time.
